            Hi, I’m Moe! I’m a software engineer with a background in IT, data analysis, and recruitment. With an MBA from North Carolina A&T State University and training from Per Scholas’ software engineering bootcamp, I’ve built over 15 projects in JavaScript, C++, SQL, and React.
            My journey into tech started with solving real-world problems—whether designing workflows in IT, creating dashboards for data-driven insights, or developing web applications. I’m passionate about building seamless, functional, and innovative solutions.

            This trivia game is for the sports geeks—the ones who watch sports radio from <span>6 AM to 6 PM</span>, who have way too many sports podcasts in their queue, and who think they know it all… or just want to learn more. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've spent years debating sports with friends, yelling at analysts on TV, and digging into stats like it's my second job. This trivia game is my way of bringing that same energy to everyone who loves the game as much as I do.

            But this isn’t just your basic trivia—expect the unexpected with wild questions, legendary moments, and a little smack talk built in. <span>Think you know the NFL? Prove it!</span>
